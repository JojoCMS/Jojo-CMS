To begin a Jojo install, place "index.php" in your web root directory (eg public_html or htdocs or www).

The example .htaccess file is for reference only, a customized .htaccess file will be supplied as part of the install process.

You may wish to use the supplied phpinfo script for checking whether your server will run Jojo. Generally it's best not to leave these in the web directory on production sites, as it gives away information to hackers.
