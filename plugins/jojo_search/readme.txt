Adds a site-search facility to the Jojo site. This will search all regular pages, and return a result set ordered by relevance.

Content created by plugins can also be included in search results, using the Plugin API. See the Articles plugin for an example of this in use.

A site search box can be included in your theme template by inserting {jojoHook hook="SearchForm"} where you want the search form to appear.
