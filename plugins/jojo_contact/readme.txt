The contact plugin is a fairly generic contact form, which sends enquiries to the contact address defined in the options.

You can customize the fields shown on your contact form in one of two ways:

- Make a copy of fields_default.php and name the copy "jojo_contact_fields.php". Place the copy in any plugin or theme, then edit the file as per the comments.
- Make a copy of fields_default.php and name the copy "fields.php" in the jojo_ontact plugin. Then edit the file as per the comments. These will become the defaults for all Jojo installs using this Jojo core.

We don't recommend editing fields_default.php directly, as it may change from time to time as new versions are released.
